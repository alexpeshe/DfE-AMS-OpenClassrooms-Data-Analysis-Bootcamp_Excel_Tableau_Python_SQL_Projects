    "## Sqlite\n",
    "We are using a file system called **sqlite**. It looks and acts like a real single user relational database (RDB). sqlite3 comes packaged with python. You do not need to install the library. You simply import it (as below).\n",
    "\n",
    "- We are using Pandas to write and read to sqlite. Pandas will manage a lot of the complexity of dealing with a RDB. There are other ways of reading and writing to a RDB that are VERY common and often used in production systems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The most common other way is to read or write to the RDB row by row. As you can see Pandas puts the entire dataframe into the RDB or extracts a new dataframe from the RDB. These are not row by row operations. These are set operations. Set operations ARE more efficient. However, it is common to use row by row operations to avoid needing large memory computers to hold the dataframes. One row only takes a few bytes. An entire dataframe could be many gigabytes and even petabytes of data. Obviously you will end up with problems with your compute resource if your files are this big. This will not happen to you in this activity and may never happen to you while you are a data analyst. Please just be aware of this. \n",
    "\n",
    "- This activity is primarily about querying a RDB, so, we are using a simple way that Pandas provides. If you want to learn the more complex way, just google 'reading and wrting to a relational database using python'. There are many resources to learn from.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data types that sqlite supports are quite limited. for example, it does not have a DATE type.  This is not a challenge for this project. However, more sophisticated database systems,such as Postgresql, have a large array of data types, such as \"DATE\", etc. that give those systems additional capability. \n",
    "\n",
    "- All of the SQL queries could also be performed on the Pandas DataFrames directly.  You may want to try this yourself for comparison (but make sure you do the SQL queries first, as this is an exercise in using SQL!).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQL Magic\n",
    "Within the Jupyter notebook we will be using something called **SQL Magic**.  This provides a convenient way to write SQL queries directly into code cells in the notebook and to read the results back into a Pandas DataFrame.  This makes working with SQL much easier!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you may need to update your sqlite version using `conda update -c anaconda sqlite` in order for the SQL Magic to work correctly.\n",

When writing, I would consider them interchangeable to a lay audience. However, I&#x27;ve been challenged on this by two people now, and am looking for some additional perspective.&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;p&gt;My default interpretation of S2 is, &quot;Of 80 people drawn uniformly at random from the population of humans, we would expect one of them to die as a result of a car accident&quot;- and I do consider this qualified statement equivalent to S1. &lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;p&gt;My questions are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;ul&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q1) Is my default interpretation indeed equivalent to Statement One?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q2) Is unusual or reckless for this to be my default interpretation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Q3) If you do think S1 and S2 different, such that to state the second when one means the first is misleading/incorrect, could you please provide a fully-qualified revision of S2 that is equivalent?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;/ul&gt;<br><br>&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s put aside the obvious quibble that S1 does not specifically refer to human deaths and assume that that is understood in context. Let us also put aside any discussion of the veracity of the claim itself: it is meant to be illustrative.&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;p&gt;As best I can tell, the disagreements I&#x27;ve heard so far seem to center around defaulting to different interpretations of the first and second statement.&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;p&gt;For the first, my challengers seem to interpret it as as 1/80 * num_deaths = number of deaths caused by car accidents, but for some reason, default to a different interpretation of the second along the lines of, &quot;if you have any set of 80 people, one of them &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; die in a car accident&quot; (which is obviously not an equivalent claim). I would think that given their interpretation of S1, their default for S2 would be to read it as (1/80 * num_dead_people = number of people who died in a car accident == number of deaths caused by car accident). I&#x27;m not sure why the discrepancy in interpretation (their default for S2 is a much stronger assumption), or if they have some innate statistical sense that I&#x27;m in fact lacking. &lt;/p&gt;<br></td>\n",

       "        <td>&lt;p&gt;I caution against expecting strong resemblance between biological and artificial neural networks. I think the name &quot;neural networks&quot; is a bit dangerous, because it tricks people into expecting that neurological processes and machine learning should be the same. The differences between biological and artificial neural networks outweigh the similarities.&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;p&gt;As an example of how this can go awry, you can also turn the reasoning in the original post on its head. You can train a neural network to learn to recognize cars in an afternoon, provided you have a reasonably fast computer and some amount of training data. You can make this a binary task (car/not car) or a multi-class task (car/tram/bike/airplane/boat) and still be confident in a high level of success. &lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;p&gt;By contrast, I wouldn&#x27;t expect a child to be able to pick out a car the day - or even the week - after it&#x27;s born, even after it has seen &quot;so many training examples.&quot; Something is obviously different between a two-year-old and an infant that accounts for the difference in learning ability, whereas a vanilla image classification neural network is perfectly capable of picking up object classification &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt; after &quot;birth.&quot; I think that there are two important differences: (1) the relative volumes of training data available and (2) a self-teaching mechanism that develops over time because of abundant training data.&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;hr&gt;<br><br>&lt;p&gt;The original post exposes two questions. The title and body of the question ask why neural networks need &quot;so many examples.&quot; Relative to a child&#x27;s experience, neural networks trained using common image benchmarks have comparatively little data.&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;p&gt;I will re-phrases the question in the title to &lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;h1&gt;&quot;How does training a neural network for a common image benchmark compare &amp;amp; contrast to the learning experience of a child?&quot;&lt;/h1&gt;<br><br>&lt;p&gt;For the sake of comparison I&#x27;ll consider the CIFAR-10 data because it is a common image benchmark. The labeled portion is composed of 10 classes of images with 6000 images per class. Each image is 32x32 pixels. If you somehow stacked the labeled images from CIFAR-10 and made a standard 48 fps video, you&#x27;d have about 20 minutes of footage.&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;p&gt;A child of 2 years who observes the world for 12 hours daily has roughly 263000 minutes (more than 4000 hours) of direct observations of the world, including feedback from adults (labels). (These are just ballpark figures -- I don&#x27;t know how many minutes a typical two-year-old has spent observing the world.) Moreover, the child will have exposure to many, many objects beyond the 10 classes that comprise CIFAR-10.&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;p&gt;So there are a few things at play. One is that the child has exposure to more data overall and a more diverse source of data than the CIFAR-10 model has. Data diversity and data volume are well-recognized as pre-requisites for robust models in general. In this light, it doesn&#x27;t seem surprising that a neural network is worse at this task than the child, because a neural network trained on CIFAR-10 is positively starved for training data compared to the two-year-old. The image resolution available to a child is better than the 32x32 CIFAR-10 images, so the child is able to learn information about the fine details of objects.&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;p&gt;The CIFAR-10 to two-year-old comparison is not perfect because the CIFAR-10 model will likely be trained with multiple passes over the same static images, while the child will see, using binocular vision, how objects are arranged in a three-dimensional world while moving about and with different lighting conditions and perspectives on the same objects.&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;p&gt;The anecdote about OP&#x27;s child implies a second question, &lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;h1&gt;&quot;How can neural networks become self-teaching?&quot;&lt;/h1&gt;<br><br>&lt;p&gt;A child is endowed with some talent for self-teaching, so that new categories of objects can be added over time without having to start over from scratch. &lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;ul&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;OP&#x27;s remark about &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/transfer-learning&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;transfer-learning&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;transfer-learning&lt;/a&gt; names one kind of model adaptation in the machine learning context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In comments, other users have pointed out that one- and few-shot learning* is another machine learning research area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/reinforcement-learning&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;reinforcement-learning&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;reinforcement-learning&lt;/a&gt; addresses self-teaching models from a different perspective, essentially allowing robots to undertake trial-and-error experimentation to find optimal strategies for solving specific problems (e.g. playing chess).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br>&lt;/ul&gt;<br><br>&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s probably true that all three of these machine learning paradigms are germane to improving how machines adapt to new computer vision tasks. Quickly adapting machine learning models to new tasks is an active area of research. However, because the practical goals of these projects (identify new instances of malware, recognize imposters in passport photos, index the internet) and criteria for success differ from the goals of a child learning about the world, and the fact that one is done in a computer using math and the other is done in organic material using chemistry, direct comparisons between the two will remain fraught.&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;hr&gt;<br><br>&lt;p&gt;As an aside, it would be interesting to study how to flip the CIFAR-10 problem around and train a neural network to recognize 6000 objects from 10 examples of each. But even this wouldn&#x27;t be a fair comparison to 2-year-old, because there would still be a large discrepancy in the total volume, diversity and resolution of the training data.&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;p&gt;*We don&#x27;t presently have a tags for one-shot learning or few-shot learning.&lt;/p&gt;<br></td>\n",

The interesting thing is that due to the direct mapping between input and output (i.e. no hidden layer), the value of each weight corresponds to how much each one of the &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$784$&lt;/span&gt; inputs are taken into account when computing the probability of each class. Now, by taking the weights for each class and reshaping them into &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$28 \\times 28$&lt;/span&gt; (i.e. the image resolution), we can tell &lt;strong&gt;what pixels are most important for the computation of each class&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/5IfjY.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;p&gt;Note, again, that these are the &lt;strong&gt;weights&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;p&gt;Now take a look at the above image and focus on the first two digits (i.e. zero and one). Blue weights mean that this pixel&#x27;s intensity contributes a lot for that class and red values mean that it contributes negatively. &lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;p&gt;Now imagine, how does a person draw a &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$0$&lt;/span&gt;? He draws a circular shape that&#x27;s empty in between. That&#x27;s exactly what the weights picked up on. In fact if someone draws the middle of the image, it counts &lt;strong&gt;negatively&lt;/strong&gt; as a zero. So to recognize zeros you don&#x27;t need some sophisticated filters and high-level features. You can just look at the drawn pixel locations and judge according to this.&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;p&gt;Same thing for the &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$1$&lt;/span&gt;. It always has a straight vertical line in the middle of the image. All else counts negatively.&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;p&gt;The rest of the digits are a bit more complicated, but with little imaginations you can see the &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$2$&lt;/span&gt;, the &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$3$&lt;/span&gt;, the &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$7$&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class=&quot;math-container&quot;&gt;$8$&lt;/span&gt;. The rest of the numbers are a bit more difficult, which is what actually limits the logistic regression from reaching the high-90s.&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;p&gt;Through this you can see that logistic regression has a very good chance of getting a lot of images right and that&#x27;s why it scores so high.&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;hr&gt;<br><br>&lt;p&gt;The code to reproduce the above figure is a bit dated, but here you go:&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-py prettyprint-override&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;import tensorflow as tf<br>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt<br>from tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist import input_data<br><br># Load MNIST:<br>mnist = input_data.read_data_sets(&quot;MNIST_data/&quot;, one_hot=True)<br><br># Create model<br>x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None, 784))<br>y = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=(None, 10))<br><br>W = tf.Variable(tf.zeros((784,10)))<br>b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros((10)))<br>z = tf.matmul(x, W) + b<br><br>y_hat = tf.nn.softmax(z)<br>cross_entropy = tf.reduce_mean(-tf.reduce_sum(y * tf.log(y_hat), reduction_indices=[1]))<br>optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.5).minimize(cross_entropy) # <br><br>correct_pred = tf.equal(tf.argmax(y_hat, 1), tf.argmax(y, 1))<br>accuracy = tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(correct_pred, tf.float32))<br><br># Train model<br>batch_size = 64<br>with tf.Session() as sess:<br><br>    loss_tr, acc_tr, loss_ts, acc_ts = [], [], [], []<br><br>    sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer()) <br><br>    for step in range(1, 1001):<br><br>        x_batch, y_batch = mnist.train.next_batch(batch_size) <br>        sess.run(optimizer, feed_dict={x: x_batch, y: y_batch})<br><br>        l_tr, a_tr = sess.run([cross_entropy, accuracy], feed_dict={x: x_batch, y: y_batch})<br>        l_ts, a_ts = sess.run([cross_entropy, accuracy], feed_dict={x: mnist.test.images, y: mnist.test.labels})<br>        loss_tr.append(l_tr)<br>        acc_tr.append(a_tr)<br>        loss_ts.append(l_ts)<br>        acc_ts.append(a_ts)<br><br>    weights = sess.run(W)      <br>    print(&#x27;Test Accuracy =&#x27;, sess.run(accuracy, feed_dict={x: mnist.test.images, y: mnist.test.labels})) <br><br># Plotting:<br>for i in range(10):<br>    plt.subplot(2, 5, i+1)<br>    weight = weights[:,i].reshape([28,28])<br>    plt.title(i)<br>    plt.imshow(weight, cmap=&#x27;RdBu&#x27;)  # as noted by @Eric Duminil, cmap=&#x27;gray&#x27; makes the numbers stand out more<br>    frame1 = plt.gca()<br>    frame1.axes.get_xaxis().set_visible(False)<br>    frame1.axes.get_yaxis().set_visible(False)<br>&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br></td>\n",
